Okay, I have the content of your android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml.Here's what I see:•AndroidManifest.xml:•It does not have a package attribute in the <manifest> tag. This means it's currently inheriting the package name from your applicationId in build.gradle.•The activity is named android:name=".MainActivity". This is a relative name, so if your applicationId is com.example.flutter_app, the system looks for com.example.flutter_app.MainActivity.•android/app/build.gradle (from previous messages):•applicationId "com.example.flutter_app"•namespace "com.example.flutter_app"•The crash log:•Shows the system is trying to launch com.marketplace.algeria.MainActivity.There's a mismatch. The build is producing an app with the ID com.example.flutter_app, but the runtime error indicates something is expecting com.marketplace.algeria. Your app's label is "Marketplace Algeria", which suggests com.marketplace.algeria is likely your intended ID.Do you want your application ID to be com.marketplace.algeria?If yes, I propose the following changes:1.In android/app/build.gradle:•Change applicationId "com.example.flutter_app" to applicationId "com.marketplace.algeria"•Change namespace "com.example.flutter_app" to namespace "com.marketplace.algeria"2.In android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml:•Add package="com.marketplace.algeria" to the <manifest> tag. So it looks like <manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android" package="com.marketplace.algeria">.After these changes, we'd also need to ensure your MainActivity.kt (or .java) file:•Is in the correct directory structure: android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/marketplace/algeria/MainActivity.kt (or the java equivalent).•Has the correct package declaration at the top: package com.marketplace.algeria;.Let me know if you want to proceed with com.marketplace.algeria as the application ID, and I can help you make the changes to build.gradle and AndroidManifest.xml. Then we can check your MainActivity file.
