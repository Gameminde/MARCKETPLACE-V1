  - Implemented `ValidationService` with comprehensive input sanitization
  - Added `SecureStorageService` with token integrity validation
  - Refactored `AuthProvider` to use dependency injection

### 2. **Input Sanitization & Validation**
- **Issue**: Missing XSS protection and weak validation
- **Fix**:
  - Added comprehensive XSS pattern detection and removal
  - Implemented strong password validation with common password checks
  - Added email format validation with RFC compliance
  - Sanitized all user inputs before processing

### 3. **Secure Token Storage**
- **Issue**: Basic token storage without integrity checks
- **Fix**:
  - Implemented SHA-256 hash verification for stored tokens
  - Added secure storage configuration for Android/iOS
  - Implemented automatic token cleanup on tampering detection

### 4. **API Configuration Security**
- **Issue**: Hardcoded API endpoints and insecure configuration
- **Fix**:
  - Created `ApiConfig` class with environment-specific settings
  - Implemented certificate pinning for production
  - Added request tracing and security headers
  - Configured proper timeouts and rate limiting

## 🐛 Bug Fixes (High Priority)

### 1. **Three.js Compatibility Issues**
- **Issue**: Version downgrade breaking 3D components
- **Fix**:
  - Updated `ParticleSystem` with proper null safety checks
  - Added WebGL support detection and fallback UI
  - Implemented memory leak prevention with proper cleanup
  - Added error boundaries for 3D rendering failures

### 2. **Memory Leak Prevention**
- **Issue**: 3D components not disposing resources properly
- **Fix**:
  - Added `useCallback` for cleanup functions
  - Implemented proper geometry disposal in `useEffect`
  - Added performance optimizations (limited DPR, disabled antialiasing)

### 3. **Async Race Conditions**
- **Issue**: Concurrent authentication requests causing issues
- **Fix**:
  - Implemented proper loading state management
  - Added request cancellation support
  - Fixed async/await patterns in AuthProvider

## 🏗️ Architecture Improvements

### 1. **SOLID Principles Implementation**
- **Single Responsibility**: Separated auth, validation, and storage concerns
- **Open/Closed**: Services are extensible without modification
- **Liskov Substitution**: Consistent interfaces across services
- **Interface Segregation**: Focused service interfaces
- **Dependency Inversion**: Dependency injection in AuthProvider

### 2. **Error Handling Standardization**
- **Issue**: Inconsistent error handling patterns
- **Fix**:
  - Created `ErrorBoundary` component for React
  - Implemented structured error responses
  - Added comprehensive error mapping and localization
  - Standardized error logging and reporting

### 3. **Configuration Management**
- **Issue**: Scattered configuration and hardcoded values
- **Fix**:
  - Centralized API configuration in `ApiConfig`
  - Environment-specific settings
  - Feature flags and debug controls
  - Validation for configuration integrity

## 🧪 Testing Infrastructure

### 1. **Comprehensive Test Coverage**
- **Created**: `auth_service_test.dart` with full test coverage
- **Includes**: Unit tests for all authentication flows
- **Mocking**: Proper mocking of dependencies
- **Edge Cases**: Error handling and validation scenarios

### 2. **Test Structure**
- Unit tests for individual services
- Integration tests for API flows
- Security tests for validation logic
- Performance tests for 3D components

---

## 🧹 Code Cleanup

### 1. **Removed Debugging Code**
- Cleaned up `console.log` and `debugPrint` statements
- Removed hardcoded test data
- Eliminated development-only code paths

### 2. **Dependency Management**
- Added missing `crypto` dependency for Flutter
- Updated Three.js version compatibility
- Added proper type definitions

### 3. **Import Organization**
- Organized imports by category
- Removed unused imports
- Added proper path aliases
