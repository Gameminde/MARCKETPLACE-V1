### ✅ Environment Validator Implemented (REAL ANALYSIS)
The Environment Validator performs actual analysis of your Flutter marketplace:

#### Flutter SDK Validation
- ✅ Validates pubspec.yaml Flutter version constraints
- ✅ Checks Dart SDK compatibility (≥3.3.0)
- ✅ Verifies system Flutter installation
- ✅ Ensures compatibility with Algeria marketplace requirements

#### Android Studio Integration
- ✅ Validates Android project structure
- ✅ Checks build.gradle configuration
- ✅ Verifies package name (detects com.example.flutter_app default)
- ✅ Validates target SDK version
- ✅ Checks signing configuration

#### Gradle Build Analysis
- ✅ Validates Gradle wrapper version (detected 8.10 ✅)
- ✅ Checks build configuration health
- ✅ Verifies compatibility with modern Android requirements

#### APK Generation Testing
- ✅ Tests actual APK build capability
- ✅ Validates build output and file generation
- ✅ Checks APK size and completeness

### ✅ Comprehensive Reporting System
- **Detailed Scoring**: Category-based scoring out of 100
- **Issue Classification**: Critical, High, Medium, Low severity levels
- **Algeria-Specific Validations**: RTL, DZD currency, CIB/EDAHABIA compliance
- **Action Plans**: Prioritized recommendations with time estimates
- **Production Readiness**: Clear go/no-go decision framework

2. **Task 5**: Implement Security Scanner (Banking-grade encryption validation)
3. **Task 6**: Implement Performance Tester (45M users scalability)
4. **Task 7**: Implement UI/UX Validator (Algeria design standards)

### Each Task Includes
- Real analysis implementation (not mocks)
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Integration with audit controller
- Detailed reporting and scoring
