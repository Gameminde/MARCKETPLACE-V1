# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the critical fixes required to resolve the Flutter marketplace application crash issues and compilation errors. The application currently fails to start due to MainActivity class not found errors, has 1176 compilation errors, and requires immediate fixes to become functional. The goal is to transform the application from a non-functional state to a working marketplace that can run successfully on Android devices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to fix the Android configuration mismatch, so that the application can start without MainActivity class not found errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is launched THEN it SHALL find the MainActivity class in the correct package location
2. WHEN the build.gradle applicationId is checked THEN it SHALL match "com.marketplace.algeria" instead of "com.example.flutter_app"
3. WHEN the AndroidManifest.xml package is verified THEN it SHALL be set to "com.marketplace.algeria"
4. WHEN the MainActivity.kt file location is validated THEN it SHALL be in the correct package directory structure
5. IF the Android configuration is corrected THEN the application SHALL start without ClassNotFoundException errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to fix all Flutter import errors, so that the application can compile without undefined reference errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Flutter imports are scanned THEN all "package:marketplace/*" imports SHALL be replaced with relative imports
2. WHEN the application is compiled THEN it SHALL have zero undefined class errors for ProductCard, CartProvider, OrderCard, and ChatCard
3. WHEN import paths are validated THEN they SHALL use correct relative paths like "../providers/auth_provider.dart"
4. WHEN the compilation process runs THEN it SHALL complete without import-related errors
5. IF all imports are corrected THEN the Flutter analyze command SHALL show no critical import errors

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to complete missing provider implementations, so that the application state management works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AuthProvider is checked THEN it SHALL have signInWithEmailAndPassword, signInWithGoogle, signOut, and continueAsGuest methods implemented
2. WHEN CartProvider is validated THEN it SHALL have items, totalPrice, shippingCost, taxAmount, and finalTotal properties available
3. WHEN User model is inspected THEN it SHALL include displayName, profilePictureUrl, isEmailVerified, isMfaEnabled, and membershipTier properties
4. WHEN provider methods are called THEN they SHALL execute without throwing "method not found" errors
5. IF all providers are completed THEN the application SHALL handle user authentication and cart operations without crashes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create missing widget components, so that the application UI can render without widget not found errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ProductCard widget is referenced THEN it SHALL exist and render product information correctly
2. WHEN OrderCard widget is used THEN it SHALL display order details without throwing widget errors
3. WHEN ChatCard widget is called THEN it SHALL render chat interface components properly
4. WHEN CartItem model is accessed THEN it SHALL have all required properties for cart functionality
5. IF all widgets are created THEN the application SHALL navigate between screens without widget-related crashes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure the application builds and runs successfully, so that basic marketplace functionality is accessible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN "flutter clean && flutter pub get" is executed THEN it SHALL complete without dependency errors
2. WHEN "flutter analyze" is run THEN it SHALL show zero critical errors that prevent compilation
3. WHEN "flutter run" is executed THEN the application SHALL start and display the splash screen
4. WHEN basic navigation is tested THEN users SHALL be able to move between main screens without crashes
5. IF the application runs successfully THEN it SHALL provide a stable foundation for Algeria marketplace features

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want to validate the fixes are working correctly, so that the application is ready for further development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL load within 5 seconds without any crash dialogs
2. WHEN core screens are accessed THEN they SHALL render without throwing unhandled exceptions
3. WHEN user interactions are performed THEN the application SHALL respond appropriately without freezing
4. WHEN the Android build process runs THEN it SHALL generate a valid APK file
5. IF all validations pass THEN the application SHALL be confirmed as functionally stable for continued development

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want a systematic approach to applying fixes, so that the resolution process is efficient and trackable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fixes are applied THEN they SHALL be implemented in the correct sequence (Android config, imports, providers, widgets)
2. WHEN each fix category is completed THEN it SHALL be validated before proceeding to the next category
3. WHEN issues are encountered THEN they SHALL be documented with specific error messages and solutions
4. WHEN the fix process is complete THEN a summary report SHALL be generated showing before/after status
5. IF the systematic approach is followed THEN the total fix time SHALL not exceed 6 hours as estimated
