# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the comprehensive audit system for the Algeria Marketplace Phase 2 application. The audit system will validate technical readiness, production quality, and compliance with Algeria banking standards to ensure the marketplace can support 45 million users with banking-grade security and performance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a technical auditor, I want to validate the build environment and process stability, so that I can ensure the application can be reliably built and deployed in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the audit system checks Flutter SDK THEN it SHALL verify version compatibility with the project requirements
2. WHEN the audit system validates Android Studio integration THEN it SHALL confirm perfect workflow integration without errors
3. WHEN the audit system runs Gradle build checks THEN it SHALL ensure no critical warnings are present
4. WHEN the audit system generates APK THEN it SHALL verify successful generation with exit code 0
5. IF any build process fails THEN the audit system SHALL log detailed error information and mark the build validation as failed

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a code quality engineer, I want to assess code architecture and quality standards, so that I can ensure the codebase meets production-ready banking standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the audit system analyzes code architecture THEN it SHALL verify Clean Architecture implementation is present
2. WHEN the audit system scans for undefined references THEN it SHALL identify any undefined classes or functions
3. WHEN the audit system checks state management THEN it SHALL verify BLoC pattern is correctly implemented
4. WHEN the audit system reviews error handling THEN it SHALL ensure comprehensive error handling is in place
5. IF any code quality issues are found THEN the audit system SHALL categorize them by severity and provide remediation suggestions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security compliance officer, I want to verify banking-grade security implementation, so that I can ensure the application meets CIB/EDAHABIA security standards for Algeria.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the audit system checks encryption THEN it SHALL verify end-to-end encryption is properly implemented
2. WHEN the audit system validates authentication THEN it SHALL ensure robust authentication mechanisms are in place
3. WHEN the audit system tests input validation THEN it SHALL verify strict input validation is implemented
4. WHEN the audit system reviews network security THEN it SHALL confirm proper network security configuration
5. IF any security vulnerabilities are detected THEN the audit system SHALL flag them as critical and provide immediate remediation steps

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want to validate application performance and scalability, so that I can ensure the system can handle 45 million users in Algeria.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the audit system measures cold start time THEN it SHALL verify startup is under 3 seconds
2. WHEN the audit system checks animation performance THEN it SHALL ensure 60 FPS is maintained
3. WHEN the audit system tests API response times THEN it SHALL verify responses are under 500ms
4. WHEN the audit system monitors memory usage THEN it SHALL ensure optimized memory consumption
5. IF performance targets are not met THEN the audit system SHALL provide detailed performance analysis and optimization recommendations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a UI/UX designer, I want to validate design compliance with Algeria standards, so that I can ensure the application meets local design requirements and accessibility standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the audit system checks color palette THEN it SHALL verify the Algeria green palette (#051F20-#DAFDE) is correctly implemented
2. WHEN the audit system validates RTL support THEN it SHALL ensure complete Arabic RTL support is functional
3. WHEN the audit system tests accessibility THEN it SHALL verify WCAG standards compliance
4. WHEN the audit system checks responsive design THEN it SHALL validate proper responsive behavior across devices
5. IF design standards are not met THEN the audit system SHALL provide specific design correction recommendations

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to generate comprehensive audit reports, so that I can track progress and make informed decisions about production readiness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the audit system completes all checks THEN it SHALL generate a detailed report with scores out of 100 for each category
2. WHEN audit issues are identified THEN the system SHALL create a prioritized list of corrective actions
3. WHEN the audit is complete THEN it SHALL provide a pre-launch validation plan
4. WHEN all criteria are met THEN the system SHALL confirm Phase 2 readiness status
5. IF critical issues remain THEN the audit system SHALL prevent production readiness confirmation until resolved

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a development team lead, I want automated audit execution capabilities, so that I can run comprehensive audits efficiently and consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the audit system is triggered THEN it SHALL execute all audit categories automatically
2. WHEN the audit system runs THEN it SHALL provide real-time progress updates
3. WHEN the audit system encounters errors THEN it SHALL continue with remaining checks and report all issues
4. WHEN the audit system completes THEN it SHALL save results in a structured format for tracking
5. IF the audit system fails to run THEN it SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery instructions
